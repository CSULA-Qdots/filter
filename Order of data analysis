Step 1: Filter data. (Filtering program)
- This must come first, as we have to get rid of the second order peak.

Step 2: Smooth data. ??? (Is there a smoothing program??)
- This must come before zeroing the data; We callibrate our background signal using two points of the original signal.
If we land on a sharp peak or a trough when picking these points, we will get a large negative signal.

Step 3: Zero data. (Zeroing program)
- This is done with the background signal of the GaAs wafer. A quadratic fit was used to model this data:
y = 0.0015873240642803 - 0.00000025667991263308*r +0.000000000011008884166353*r*r
r is the wavelength, and y is the strength of the signal.

Step 4: Fit data. (IPF)
- We use equal-width Gaussians with NO autozeroing (it's been taken care of by the zeroing program in the previous step).
We fit 4 peaks and generate a list of results, which we put in a spreadsheet.

Step 5: Bin the data. (Histogram)
- This is easy.
